How do we determine the total change in $z$?\n\nOur total differential of our function $z$ is equal to the sum of the [partial differentials](partial-derivatives.md) in $x$ and $y$.\n\nThe differential in $z$ is defined as:\n$$\ndz=f_x(x,y)dx+f_y(x,y)dy\n$$\n\n##### Example\nLet $f(x)=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. Use the total differential to find the change in $f(x,y)$ when $(x,y)$ changes from $(3,4)$ to $(3.04, 3.98)$\n\nWe find the partial derivatives with respect of $x$ and $y$ of the function.\n$$\ndf=\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}dx + \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\n$$\nAnd we substitute our values of $x_0, y_0$, in this case $3, 4$, and our differential values, $0.04, -0.02$, for $dx, dy$\n$$\ndf \\approx\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{3^2+4^2}}(0.04)+\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3^2+4^2}}(-0.02) \\approx 0.008\n$$\nThese equations are approximated since their composed of infinitely many tiny sums.\n\n#math #calculus","lastmodified":"2022-04-04T20:10:37.078086407Z","tags":null},"/transitive-relations":{"title":"Transitive Relations","content":"### Transitive Relations\nA [relation](relations.md) $R$ is _transitive_ if we can find a [hypothetical syllogism](laws-of-logical-inference.md) within its elements.\n$$\n(xRy)\\land(yRz) \\to xRz\n$$\n\n#### Example\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\tA\u0026=\\{1,2,3\\} \\\\\n\tR\u0026=\\{(1,2), (2,3),(1,3)\\}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n#logic #setTheory","lastmodified":"2022-04-04T20:10:37.078086407Z","tags":null},"/truth-tables":{"title":"Truth Tables","content":"---\n\n### Truth Tables\nTruth tables evaluate the results of [compound propositions](logical-connectors.md) by evaluating each [simple proposition](propositions.md) and [finding their value](evaluating-arguments.md).\n\nThe number of possibilities is equal to $2^n$, where $n$ is the number of simple propositions.\n\n##### Example:\n$p\\to (\\neg p \\to p)$ \n\n| $p$ | $\\neg p$ | $\\neg p \\to p$ | $p\\to (\\neg p \\to p)$ |\n|","lastmodified":"2022-04-04T20:10:37.078086407Z","tags":null},"/universal-set":{"title":"Universal Set","content":"### Universal Set\nIn [set theory](set-theory.md), the Universal Set $U$ contains all the considered elements.\n\n#logic #setTheory","lastmodified":"2022-04-04T20:10:37.078086407Z","tags":null},"/universe-and-solution-set":{"title":"Universe and Solution Set","content":"### Universe and Solution Set\nLet $P$ be a [predicate](predicates.md).\nThe universe $U$ is the [set](set-theory.md) that entails all the possible values for the variables in $P$.\nThe solution set $S$ is the [subset](subsets.md) of $U$ for which $P$ is true.\n\n##### Example\n$P(x)$ is the statement $x \u003c 5$ .
