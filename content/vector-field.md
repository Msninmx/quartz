### Vector Field
A vector field is every field where each point is subjected to some function. They're are commonly represented as fields with arrows, representing the [[vector|vectors]].


#### Conservative vector field
A vector field $F$ is considered conservative if $F$ can be written as a [[gradient-vector|gradient]] of a some function $\phi$, such that:
$$
F(x,y,z)=\nabla \cdot \phi
$$
To determine if a vector field $F(x,y)=Mi+Nj$ is conservative:
$$
\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}
$$
