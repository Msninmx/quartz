### Reflexive Relations
A [relation](relations.md) $R$ is _reflexive_ if each element in the single set that created the relation is paired with each itself.
$$
\forall x \in A, xRx
$$
For every $x$ in the set $A$, $x$ is related with $x$.

#### Example
$$
\begin{align}
	A&=\{1,2,3\} \\
	R&=\{(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (1,3)\}
\end{align}
$$
