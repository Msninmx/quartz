### Coulomb's Law
$$
F=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}\frac{|q_1q_2|}{r^2}
$$
The force of attraction between two electrically charged particles is inversely proportional to the distance between them.

The first part of the right hand side is the dielectric constant, a physical constant that shows how a material is affected and affects an electric field.
$$
\begin{align}
	\epsilon_0=8.854\times10^{-12}C^2/N \cdot m^2 \\
	\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}=k=9.0\times10^9N \cdot m^2/C^2
\end{align}
$$
