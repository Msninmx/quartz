### Experimental Uncertainty
Errors can appear from many different sources:
- Uncalibrated equipment
- Random errors
- Systematic errores

#### Types of Uncertainty
**A:** One must use a statistical procedure in order to find their numerical value.

**B:** The types of uncertainty where one does not use a statistical procedure to find their value, instead, their estimation is based on previously established judgments and agreements between previous experimenters, as well as pre established theoretic models.

To find average:
$$\bar{x}=\frac{\Sigma_i x_i}{n}$$
To find uncertainty:
$$u_x=s_x/\sqrt{n}$$
Where $s_x$ is the standard deviation:
$$s_x=\sqrt{\frac{\Sigma_i(x_i-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$$
Standard deviation is the measurement of how different each term in the series is different to the average.
