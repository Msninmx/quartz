### Parametric Equations
Physical phenomena, like the movement of a particle, can be described using a coordinate system $x,y,z$, and with a fourth parameter __time__.

A parametric equation are equations that allow us to represent a surface or [[notes/parametric-curves|curve]] as the function of a parameter.

#### Formal Definition
If $f$ and $g$ are continuous functions defined over an interval $I$, then $x=f(t)$ and $y=g(t)$ are parametric equations with respect to the variable $t$.

##### Example
Graph the curve $C$ that contains the equations
$$
\begin{align}
	x = t^2 &&
	y = t^3
\end{align}
$$
in the interval $-1\leq t \leq 2$

#### Derivation
Parametric equations can be derived just like normal functions.
$$
\frac{d}{dt}f(t)=\frac{dx}{dt}
$$
They can also be derived with respect to other parametric equations.
$$
\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt}
$$
