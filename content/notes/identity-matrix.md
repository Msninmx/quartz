### Identity Matrix
The [[notes/matrix]] $I_n$ is the matrix where all the numbers on the diagonal are $1$, starting from the upper left corner, and everything else is $0$. Since the matrix only has one argument, it's a square.
$$
I_3=
\begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & 1 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
