### Partial Derivatives
[Multivariable functions](multivariable-functions.md) require multivariable derivatives; for each variable in the function, a separate derivative is required.

#### How to derive
1. Function $z=f(x,y)$
2. Partial derivative with to respect to $x$.
3. $y$ stays constant.

Partial derivative with respect to $x$:
$$f_x(x,y)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$$
Different nomenclature:
$$\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = f_x(x,y)=D_x(x,y)=\frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial x}$$
Geometrically, partial derivatives to the point $P(a,b,c)$ are the tangent slopes to the traces $C_1$ and $C_2$, on the plane $y=b$ and $x=a$.
