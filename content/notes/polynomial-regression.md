### Polynomial Regression
Like [[notes/linear-regression|linear regressions]], polynomial regressions are ways to predict values of some dataset. These are used when a linear approximation isn't good enough to fit the values.

Polynomial regressions have the form:
$$
y=\beta_0+\beta_1x+\beta_2x^2+\dots+\beta_kx^k
$$
