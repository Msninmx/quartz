### Vector Spaces
A vector space is any space with elements, called vectors.
$$
\textbf{A}=\hat{x}A_x+\hat{y}A_y+\hat{z}A_z
$$
Where each component of the base is a unit. 

A group of vectors $B$ of a vector space $V$ is is called a base of $V$ if and only if:
- $B$ is linearly independent
- $B$ generates $V$

For a group of vectors to be linearly dependent,  there can exist no possible way to add these vectors to get zero.

Let $V$ be a set over which we define two operations, called summation and scalar multiplication. If elements $\textbf{u}$ and $\textbf{v}$ are in $V$, the sum of $\textbf{u}$ and $\textbf{v}$ is denoted $\textbf{u}\textbf{v}$, and if $c$ is some scalar, the scalar multiple of $\textbf{u}$ by $c$ is denoted by $c\textbf{u}$.
