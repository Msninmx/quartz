### Propositions
In [[notes/logic]], propositions are statements which must be either true or false. There are 3 states a set of propositions can have:
- Tautology: Every argument is true
- Contradiction: A mix of true and false arguments.
- Fallacy: Every argument is false.

Simple propositions are represented with lowercase letters: $p, q, r, s, t$, as opposed to [[notes/compound-propositions|compound propositions]].
