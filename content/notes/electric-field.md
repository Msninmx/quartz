### Electric Field
Two particles $A$ and $B$ exercise forces against each other. We remove the smaller of the particles and replace it with a point $P$. The body $A$ generates an electric field $\vec{E}$ on point $P$ defined as:
$$
\vec{E}=\frac{\vec{F}_0}{q_0}
$$
Where $\vec{F}_0$ is the original force created by $A$, and $q_0$ is the charge of point $P$.

Negative charges produce forces going inwards, and positive charges forces going outwards.
