### $\subset$ and $\in$
The [[notes/subsets|subset]] symbol $\subset$ is only used when referring to sets and not individual elements inside the sets.

The symbol $\in$ is used to show whether or not an element is inside a given set. If the element shown is inside brackets, it is its own set, and must be treated accordingly.
$$
\begin{align}
	A = \{ 5, &\{7\}, 9, \{2\} \} \\
	\{ 7 \} &\in A \\
	7 &\notin A
\end{align}
$$
The [[notes/null-set|null set]] is a subset of every set, but is not always included as an element is every set.

##### Examples:
Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be the following sets:
$$
\begin{align}
	A &= \{ \{1,3\}, \{2,4,6\}, \{8,9\} \} \\
	B &= \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \} \\
	C &= \{ \{1\}, \{3\}, \{2\} ,\{4\}, \{6\}, \{8\}, \{9\} \} \\
\end{align}
$$
Is $A = B = C$ true?
No, sets with sets with elements in them are different from sets with only elements.
