### Predicates
A predicate is a statement that follows the following three rules:
1. It contains 1 or more variables
2. It's not a [proposition](propositions.md), _but_
3. It becomes a proposition when its variables are substituted for concrete values.

##### Example
$\text{P(x): x is a mexican writer}$ is an open statement.

If we substitute true values for x, it becomes a true proposition, on the contrary, a false proposition.

##### Example
$\text{P(a, b): a + b is a even number}$

Predicates can be undefined, depending on the value of the variables, in this case if we assign non number values to a, b.
