### Quantifiers
$\forall$ is the universal quantifier
$\exists$ is the existential quantifier

Statements with expressions like: some, there exists, there are some, for all, every, etc, are existential quantifiers and universal quantifiers respectively. These evaluate the variables that go inside [[notes/predicates]].
