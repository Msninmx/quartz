### Universe and Solution Set
Let $P$ be a [[notes/predicates|predicate]].
The universe $U$ is the [[notes/set-theory|set]] that entails all the possible values for the variables in $P$.
The solution set $S$ is the [[notes/subsets|subset]] of $U$ for which $P$ is true.

##### Example
$P(x)$ is the statement $x < 5$ . What are the truth values of $P(3)$ and $P(8)$?
True and False.
