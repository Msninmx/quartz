### Truth Tables
Truth tables evaluate the results of [[notes/logical-connectors|compound propositions]] by evaluating each [[notes/propositions|simple proposition]] and [[notes/evaluating-arguments|finding their value]].

The number of possibilities is equal to $2^n$, where $n$ is the number of simple propositions.

##### Example:
$p\to (\neg p \to p)$ 

| $p$ | $\neg p$ | $\neg p \to p$ | $p\to (\neg p \to p)$ |
| --- | -------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| V   | F        | V              | V                     |
| F   | V        | F              | V                     |

Since every possibility is True, it is a tautology.
