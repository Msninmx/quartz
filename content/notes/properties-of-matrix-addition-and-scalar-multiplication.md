### Properties of Matrix Addition and Scalar Multiplication
The following properties apply both to [[notes/matrix-addition|addition]] and [[notes/matrix-multiplication|multiplication]]:
1. $A + B = B + A$: Commutativity
2. $A + (B+C) = (A+B)+C$: Associativity
3. $A(BC)=(AB)C$: Distributivity
4. $A(B+C)=AB+AC$
5. $c(AB)=(cA)B=A(cB)$
