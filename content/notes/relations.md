### Relations
A relations is a [[notes/set-theory|set]] of ordered pairs created by taking elements from either a single set $A$, or two sets $A$, $B$.

If $A$ and $B$ are sets, $R$ is relation between the sets.
$$
R=\{(a,b) | a \in A, b \in B\}
$$
A relation can be formed on a single set $A$, joining elements of the set with themselves.
$$A \times A = A^2$$
If $(a,b)\in R$, then we say that $a$ is in relation with $b$: $aRb$
If $(a,b) \notin R$, then we say that a is not in relation with b: $a \cancel{R}b$
