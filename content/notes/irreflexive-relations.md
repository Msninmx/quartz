### Irreflexive Relations
A [[notes/relations|relation]] $R$ is _irreflexive_ if each element in the single set that created the relation is **not** paired with each itself.
$$
\forall x \in A, x\cancel{R}x
$$
For every $x$ in the set $A$, $x$ is **not** related with $x$.

#### Example
$$
\begin{align}
	A&=\{1,2,3\} \\
	R&=\{(1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (1,2)\}
\end{align}
$$
