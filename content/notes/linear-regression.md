### Linear Regression
A linear regression is a method to predict future values of a function and has the form:
$$
y=f(x)=\beta_0+\beta_1x
$$
Where $\beta$ are coefficients that define the function.

#### Finding $\beta$
One method of finding these these coefficients is with minimum squares. This method is based on finding the minimum of the sum of errors of the function.

Without going into numerical detail, the values of $\beta$ are:
