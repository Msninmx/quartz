### Bernoulli's Equation
Bernoulli's equation states that the properties of a fluid in one part of a system should be constant.

Very important in fluid problems alongside the [[notes/equation-of-continuity|equation of continuity]].
$$P_1+\frac{1}{2}\rho v_1^2+\rho gy_1=P_2+\frac{1}{2}\rho v_2^2+\rho gy_2$$
where $P_1$ is the pressure at point 1, and $P_2$ is the pressure at point 2, $\rho$ being the density of water, and $y$ being the height at each point.
