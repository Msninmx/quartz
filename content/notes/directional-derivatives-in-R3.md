### Directional Derivatives in $\mathbb{R}^3$
The [directional derivative](directional-derivative.md) in $f$ in the direction of $u$ is defined as:
$$
D_uf(x_0,y_0,z_0)=f_x(x_0,y_0,z_0)u_1+f_y(x_0,y_0,z_0)u_2+f_z(x_0,y_0,z_0)u_3
$$
Let $f$ be a function of $3$ variables that is differentiable in $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$
1. If $\nabla f(x_0,y_0,z_0) = 0$, then all the directional derivatives in $f$ are $0$.
2. If $\nabla f(x_0,y_0,z_0) \neq 0$, then $\nabla f(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is the largest of all the possible directional derivatives in $f$. The opposite direction gives us the smallest possible derivative.
