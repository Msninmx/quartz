### Magnetism
Magnetic lines emerge from the North pole and enter the South pole.

A smaller magnet will align parallel to the magnetic field and its north pole always points in the same direction as the field.

The intensity of the magnetic field of a magnet is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance.
