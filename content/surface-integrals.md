### Surface Integrals
Surface integrals are ways to integrate surfaces. This is done by converting the function defining the surface, normally defined as $r$, into coordinates, $u$ and $v$.
$$  \iint_{S}f(x,y,z)\mathrm{d}S=\iint_{D}f(r(u,v))\left |\frac{\partial r}{\partial u}\times \frac{\partial r}{\partial v}\right |\mathrm{d}u\mathrm{d}v
$$

Surfaces defined as $z=g(x,y)$ can be parameterized as
$$
\begin{align}
x=x &&
y=y &&
z=g(x,y)
\end{align}
$$
