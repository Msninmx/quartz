#### Quadratic surfaces
The equation of a quadratic surface is a second grade equation of the form 
$$Ax^2+By^2+Cz^2+Dxy+Exz+Fyz+Gx+Hy+Hz+J=0$$
There are 6 basic quadratic surfaces:
- Ellipsoid: Egg-shaped
- Single sheet hyperboloid: Hourglass
- Double sheet hyperboloid: Disconnected half eggs
- Elliptic cone: Sharp hourglass
- Elliptic paraboloid: Rounded cone
- Hyperbolic paraboloid: Saddle

These surfaces take place in [3D space](coordinate-systems-in-3-dimensions.md).
