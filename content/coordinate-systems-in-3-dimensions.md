### Coordinate Systems in 3 Dimensions
Our 3 coordinates form 3 planes, $x, y, z$, which forms 8 quadrants. Points in this coordinate system have the form $P(x, y, z)$. $x$ moves towards us, $y$ to the right, and $z$ upwards; each pair of axes forms a separate plane.

##### Example:
How is $y=5$ represented on $\mathbb{R}^3$?

$y=5$ appears as a plane parallel to the $xz$ plane, on $y=5$.

What is $y=x$?

The plane is halfway between the $x$ and $y$ axes.

Assigning values to these axes shows us where the origin of our plane is going to be.
