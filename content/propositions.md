### Propositions
In [logic](logic.md), propositions are statements which must be either true or false. There are 3 states a set of propositions can have:
- Tautology: Every argument is true
- Contradiction: A mix of true and false arguments.
- Fallacy: Every argument is false.

Simple propositions are represented with lowercase letters: $p, q, r, s, t$, as opposed to [compound propositions](compound-propositions.md).
