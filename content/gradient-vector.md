### Gradient Vector
If $f$ is a [function with two variable](multivariable-functions.md) $x$ and $y$, the _gradient_ of $f$ is the vectorial function $\triangledown f$, and is defined as:
$$
\nabla f = \langle \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial y}{\partial y} \rangle
$$
its main use is in finding the [directional derivative](directional-derivative.md) of a function.
