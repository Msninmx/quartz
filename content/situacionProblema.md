Differential equations that model:
- $F(x)=LIB$
	- $F(x)$ is a function of force based on distance across the board
	- $L$ is the distance between the wires
	- $I$ is the current
	- $B$ is the magnetic force
- $v(t)=v_0+at$
	- $v(t)$ is a function of velocity based on time
	- $v_0$ is the current velocity at that position
	- $a$ is the acceleration
	- $t$ is the time
- $v(x)=v_0+a\sqrt{\frac{2x}{a}}$
	- $v(x)$ is a function for velocity based on position, using the same variables as the previous function.

$a$ can be represented as $\frac{LIB}{m}$, where $m$ is the mass of the rod.

Velocity versus time:
$$
\frac{dv}{dt}=\frac{LIB}{m}t
$$
Position relative to time:
$$
\frac{dx}{dt}=\sqrt{2\cdot \frac{LIB}{m}x}
$$

#### Steps:
