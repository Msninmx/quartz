### Universe and Solution Set
Let $P$ be a [predicate](predicates.md).
The universe $U$ is the [set](set-theory.md) that entails all the possible values for the variables in $P$.
The solution set $S$ is the [subset](subsets.md) of $U$ for which $P$ is true.

##### Example
$P(x)$ is the statement $x < 5$ . What are the truth values of $P(3)$ and $P(8)$?
True and False.
